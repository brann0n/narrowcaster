# Narrowcaster
_This Repo consists of two merged projects: Vigmo API & Vigmo Admin. Since the name vigmo is currently in use by a security company, the name has been mostly refactored out of the project._

## Hosting
There currently is an activly hosted deployment of the narrowcasting service available on my server:
> UI  [https://narrowcaster.ba99.nl](https://narrowcaster.ba99.nl)  
> API [https://narrowcaster-api.ba99.nl](https://narrowcaster-api.ba99.nl)  

The API can be explored using the swagger endpoint, linked on the api homepage.

The UI can be modified using the auto generated admin panel:
